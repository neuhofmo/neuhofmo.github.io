# About Me
I am a data scientist and a biologist. I am currently doing my PhD at the [Rechavi Lab](http://www.odedrechavilab.com/) at Tel Aviv University.

# This Blog
This blog will be about things that interest me, and hopefully about things that are of interest to other people.

This blog is going to be about data science, python, computational biology
and occasionally other topics that made me excited for at least a moment.
As you can understand, this blog is dedicated to the things that excite me most
(at least professionally; otherwise it would be 100% about dogs).
