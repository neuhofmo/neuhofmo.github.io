# About Me
I am a data scientist and a biologist.  
I am currently doing my PhD in computational biology at the [Rechavi Lab](http://www.odedrechavilab.com/) at Tel Aviv University, where I study ancient DNA, genetics and epigenetics. You can read more about some of the papers I co-authored on my [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=dGPSoyIAAAAJ).

# This Blog
This blog is going to be about data science, python, computational biology
and occasionally other topics that made me excited for at least a moment.
As you can understand, this blog is dedicated to the things that excite me most
(at least professionally; otherwise it would be 100% about dogs).
